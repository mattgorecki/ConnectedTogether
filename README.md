# ConnectedTogether
Cooperatively building community networks.

We rely on the internet for so many aspects of our daily lives.  It's core to how we communicate and how we learn new information.  But the networks we use aren't owned by us.  We're subject to the whims of a handful of corporations whose only goal is to generate more profits.  Because of that, we have networks that are just good enough to keep us paying the monthly bill.

I think we can do better together.  I think we can build a network that we own entirely. A network that can connect every single person in our community no matter where they live or how much money they make.  We can build a network that outlasts and outperforms any corporation.

There's still room for those corporations to provide services to us whether that's connectivity to the greater internet or better cell phone coverage.  However, we should own the wire that runs to our houses so that if our internet service provider isn't actually providing the services we want, we can switch to someone who will.

**The Goal**
Construct a network that connects all of our homes and businesses. This network will allow us to do what we need, however that might change over the decades.  For most people this will be a connection to the internet.  For some, it might be used to privately connect to office locations together.  Or maybe a city could use it to collect information from all of their traffic lights in order to better control them.

The underlying technologies will vary and will have to evolve over time depending on the situation.  Wireless radios and towers are a great and cheap way to start providing services.  As more people sign up and participate, we will have the resources to bury our own duct and fiber to further increase network capacities.

**Principles**
- Inclusivity: Every person should be connected no matter their status or location.
- Longevity: An organization and network to last more than 100 years.
- Maintainability: The member owners will be able to take care of the network.
- Transparency: Everything is open from accounting to network administration.
- Evolvability: Incorporate new technologies and ideas as technology improves.
